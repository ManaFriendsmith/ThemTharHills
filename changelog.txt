---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
  Compatibility:
    - Updated for compatibility with Factorio 2.0 and Space Age.
  Features:
    - New intermediates added to Moderate difficulty: Stepper motor.
    - New intermediates added to Maximal difficulty: Semiboloid stator and [space-age] hydrocoptic marzelvane.
  Changes:
    - Broke out prototype-manipulation functions into a separate mod, so I don't need to update every single mod whenever there is inevitably a small bug.
    - Difficulty selection is now handled by a single option in pf-functions. The options are now Minimal (comparable to old easy mode), Moderate (comparable to old hard mode, some things are softened when used with Space Age to expedite getting off Nauvis), and Maximal (lots of extra middle fingers to you and your plans.)
    - Moved depleted acid to Them Thar Hills from BrimStuff.
    - Removed high voltage power regulator.
  Balancing:
    - Transceiver and heavy cable are no longer in Minimal mode.
    - Lots of minor recipe tweaks across the board.

Version: 1.0.8
  Compatibility:
    - Corrected a reference to a removed icon for compatibility with Lunar Landings.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.7
  Compatibility:
    - Support for Lunar Landings added.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.6
  Compatibility:
    - Fixed softlock with Freight Forwarding + Krastorio2 + BZ tungsten + BrimStuff: Removes HCl/aqua regia from gold processing, gold can now be processed in burner chemical plant. (Not needed for BZ gas without brimstuff: BZ alone does not make a distinction between recipes that can be made in burner vs. electric chem plant.)
    - With FF + K2 + tungsten and neither brimstuff or natural gas, just removes tungsten and tungsten-derivatives from the electric chemical plant recipe. It's still needed for the oil rig and refinery.
    - Fixed softlock with Krastorio2 and not BZ chlorine: hydrogen chloride is unlocked earlier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.5
  Changes:
    - Renamed saltpeter to potassium nitrate for consistency across translations.
  Locale:
    - Added Spanish locale by Sigmaleph.
  Features:
    - Added aqua regia to simplify the pipe routing in gold ore processing if you have a mod that adds hydrogen chloride. Can be disabled in startup settings if you want to avoid rebuilding your gold refining area.
  Compatibility:
    - Add support for Icon Badges

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.4
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed startup error when used with SE and not If I Had A Nickel
    - Fixed startup error when used with SE and not Lasing Around (Absolutely baffling this one. No idea what I was thinking.)
    - SE maintenance recipes now actually respect the setting to disable them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.3
  Compatibility:
    - (SE) Gold core fragment processing is now in the correct place in the crafting menu.
  Features:
    - (bzgold) Added alternate recipe for integrated circuits which uses silver instead of copper. Only applies if the integrated circuit requires both copper and gold, i.e. if you don't have a mod adding silicon.
  Balancing:
    - (bzgold) Advanced cables need +1 (expensive mode: +2) silver wire. +an equal amount if Brass Tacks is installed (more demand for non-circuit copper = more silver byproduct to get rid of)
  Changes:
    - Renamed items folder to icons, like every other mod.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed startup error with Deadlock stacking/crating

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Changelog no longer says "initial fake release."
    - Off to a great start with this one, I see.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
  Info:
    - Initial release.
